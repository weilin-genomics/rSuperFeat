# rSuperFeat

rSuperFeat includes a package that can be used to evaluate the cellular states or features that are possibly correlated to the function or the fate of the tissue. The user can input a digital expression matrix from a barcoded-bead-based single-cell RNAseq technique as well as a set of model parameters downloaded from rSuperFeat_Models repository.
